# SimpleTabList
This Spigot plugin is an open-source projekt. It's kinda also planned to show how easy it is to make simple plugins which normaly cost much money for quite the same content or being coded quite bad with many configs just for permissions and stuff.

## Dependencys

- [LuckPerms](https://luckperms.net/download)
- [PlaceholderAPI](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/placeholderapi.6245/)

## Support

- [Discord](https://discord.gg/J6wQn3bAkm)

What does this plugin do
This Plugin is showing prefix & suffixes in the TabList & Chat which you can provide by LuckPerm Groups.
Since version 1.7 there is now also a staff chat.
Since version 1.8 you can mute other players.
Since version 2.1 you can set your own homes. (you can limit it in the main config)
